# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To start the service on localhost:3000, please run `npm run server` 

## Features

Aside from accomplishing the requirements for this coding challenge, this application features the following code of interest:

- Custom rolled API layer using RTK Query to ping the json-server data
- CSS all hand rolled, no frameworks
- CSS animations (click the `Heart` icon)
- Emotion styled for styled component CSS
- CSS variables in index.css for easy customization
- feed posts are clickable if truncated (because they're longer than 2 lines)
- Passes all Axe tests for 'bare minimum' a11y support
- Application is responsive

## Wireframes
![Alt text](README.png?raw=true "Rough Wireframes")

This is crude, but this is kind of what I envisioned. While the "author popup" was not implemented, the favorites, and click to show text were implemented (See `Features` section)
